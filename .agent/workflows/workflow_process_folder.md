# Workflow: Process Folder

1.  **Run batch processing**:
    ```bash
    uv run run_folder.py <INPUT_FOLDER_PATH> \
      --workers 5
    # Outputs will be auto-generated in outputs/folder_runs/<FOLDER_NAME>
    ```

2.  **Register output for frontend**:
    ```bash
    # Note: Use the actual output path generated by the script
    uv run python scripts/register_dataset.py outputs/folder_runs/<FOLDER_NAME> --name "<DISPLAY_NAME>"
    ```

3.  **View**:
    Open the frontend and select your new dataset. All books in the folder will be loaded.
