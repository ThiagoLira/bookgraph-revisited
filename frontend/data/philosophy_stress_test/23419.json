          "as one surprised general reported: Whenever anyone comes face to face with Socrates and has a conversation with him, what invariably happens is that, although he may have started on a completely different subject first, Socrates will keep heading him off as they’re talking until he has him trapped into giving an account of his present life-style and the way he has spent his life in the past. And once he has him trapped, Socrates won’t let him go before he has well and truly cross-examined him from every angle.",
          "Socrates compared living without thinking systematically to practising an activity like pottery or shoemaking without following or even knowing of technical procedures.",
          "Socrates described a correct belief held without an awareness of how to respond rationally to objections as true opinion, and contrasted it unfavourably with knowledge, which involved understanding not only why something was true, but also why its alternatives were false.",
          "As Socrates had learned, the thinking at its basis, though carefully disguised, may be badly awry.",
          "But we acquire a misplaced respect for others when we concentrate solely on their conclusions – which is why Socrates urged us to dwell on the logic they used to reach them.",
          "The idea had first emerged some time before the trial, during a conversation between Socrates and Polus, a well-known teacher of rhetoric visiting Athens from Sicily.",
          "Socrates listened politely, then answered with a series of logical arguments attempting to show that happiness lay in doing good.",
          "Socrates courteously admitted that it might be very easy to find people who liked Archelaus, and harder to find anyone to support the view that doing good brought one happiness",
          "But what Socrates zealously denied was that this widespread support for Polus’s argument could on its own in any way prove it correct",
          "The trouble is, Polus, you’re trying to use on me the kind of rhetorical refutation which people in lawcourts think is successful.",
          "if we listen to Socrates in conversation with his friend Crito",
          "He had long considered Socrates the exemplar of how one might, through philosophy, rise above external circumstance",
          "It was here that Montaigne read Socrates’ (‘the wisest man that ever was’) steadfast address to the impatient jurors of Athens in a Latin edition of Plato translated by Marsilio Ficino;",
          "following in the footsteps of his favourite philosopher: When they asked Socrates where he came from, he did not say ‘From Athens’, but ‘From the world.’",
          "the most basic lesson in intellectual humility offered by the greatest of the ancient philosophers: The wisest man that ever was, when asked what he knew, replied that the one thing he did know was that he knew nothing.",
          "So strong is this bias, Montaigne wondered whether the majority of university scholars would have appreciated Socrates, a man they professed to revere above all others, if he had approached them in their own towns, devoid of the prestige of Plato’s dialogues, in his dirty cloak, speaking in plain language"

          "We are often, in the words of the Epicurean poet Lucretius, like ‘a sick man ignorant of the cause of his malady’.",
          "Lucretius lamented the way in which what we want is ‘chosen by hearsay rather than by the evidence of [our] own senses’.",
          "Lucretius lent force to Epicurus’s intellectual defence of simplicity by helping us, in superlative Latin verse, to feel the pleasures of inexpensive things: We find that the requirements of our bodily nature are few indeed, no more than is necessary to banish pain, and also to spread out many pleasures for ourselves. Nature does not periodically seek anything more gratifying than this, not complaining if there are no golden images of youths about the house who are holding flaming torches in their right hands to illuminate banquets that go on long into the night. What does it matter if the hall doesn’t sparkle with silver and gleam with gold, and no carved and gilded rafters ring to the music of the lute? Nature doesn’t miss these luxuries when people can recline in company on the soft grass by a running stream under the branches of a tall tree and refresh their bodies pleasurably at small expense. Better still if the weather smiles on them, and the season of the year stipples the green grass with flowers.",
          "Lucretius articulated the choice. In a world without Epicurean values: Mankind is perpetually the victim of a pointless and futile martyrdom, fretting life away in fruitless worries through failure to realise what limit is set to acquisition and to the growth of genuine pleasure. But at the same time: It is this discontent that has driven life steadily onward, out to the high seas …",

In the first work, Nietzsche attacked the notion of morality as nothing more than institutionalised weakness, and he criticised past philosophers for their unquestioning acceptance of moral precepts. In On the Genealogy of Morals, subtitled 'A Polemic', Nietzsche furthers his pursuit of a clarity that is...",

But if the dog does not follow, it will be compelled in any case. So it is with men too: even if they don’t want to, they will be compelled to follow what is destined.",
