          "The greatest defender of this approach is Immanuel Kant, to whom we turn in the next chapter.",
          "Kant’s Case for Rights Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) offers an alternative account of duties and rights, one of the most powerful and influential accounts any philosopher has produced.",
          "Immanuel Kant offered a more powerful version of the choosing self.",
          "Kant writes of “the confusion of the philosophers concerning the supreme principle of morals.” The ancient philosophers made the mistake of “devoting their ethical investigations entirely to the definition of the concept of the highest good,” and then trying to make this good “the determining ground of the moral law.”",
          "Immanuel Kant, “Duties Toward the Body in Respect of Sexual Impulse” (1784–85), translated by Louis Infield and published in Immanuel Kant, Lectures on Ethics (Cambridge, Mass.\n: Hackettt Publishing, 1981), p. 164.",

          "But as Kant reminds us, a person is not a thing, “not something to be used merely as a means.”",
          "But any principle based on interest “was bound to be always a conditioned one and could not possibly serve as a moral law.”25",
          "Kant’s categorical imperative tells us to treat everyone with respect, as an end in itself.",
          "Kant seems to suggest that answering to duty and acting autonomously are one and the same.",
          "Kant seems to think that we will all agree on the same moral law.",
          "Kant argues that if morality is more than a matter of prudential calculation, it must take the form of a categorical imperative.",
          "Kant says we can’t help but understand ourselves from both standpoints—the empirical realm of physics and biology, and an “intelligible” realm of free human agency.",
          "Kant argues that only from this second (intelligible) standpoint can I regard myself as free, “for to be independent of determination by causes in the sensible world (and this is what reason must always attribute to itself) is to be free.”29",
          "“When we think of ourselves as free, we transfer ourselves into the intelligible world as members and recognize the autonomy of the will together with its consequence—morality.”30",
          "“To argue freedom away,” Kant writes, “is as impossible for the most abstruse philosophy as it is for the most ordinary human reason.”33",
          "Kant considered this practice a violation of human dignity.",
          "supports the Kantian thought that there is a morally relevant difference between a lie and a misleading truth.",
          "And on Kant’s moral theory, it’s the intention, or motive, that matters.",
          "Kant’s point is not that this state of affairs, in which people parse politicians’ denials for their literal meaning, is somehow better than one in which nobody believes politicians at all. That would be a consequentialist argument. Kant’s point is rather that a misleading statement that is nonetheless true does not coerce or manipulate the listener in the same way as an outright lie.",
          "So there is reason to conclude that, on Kant’s moral theory, true but misleading statements—to a murderer at the door, the Prussian censors, or the special prosecutor—are morally permissible in a way that bald-faced lies are not.",
          "You may think that I’ve worked too hard to save Kant from an implausible position. Kant’s claim that it’s wrong to lie to the murderer at the door may not ultimately be defensible. But the distinction between an outright lie and a misleading truth helps illustrate Kant’s moral theory.",
          "Kant and justice Unlike Aristotle, Bentham, and Mill, Kant wrote no major work of political theory, only some essays.",
          "Liberal theories of justice, from Kant to Rawls, worry that teleological conceptions are at odds with freedom.",

          "Justice, Telos, and Honor Seen in this way, the dustup over cheerleaders in West Texas is a short course in Aristotle’s theory of justice.",
          "Central to Aristotle’s political philosophy are two ideas, both present in the argument over Callie: 1. Justice is teleological. Defining rights requires us to figure out the telos (the purpose, end, or essential nature) of the social practice in question. 2. Justice is honorific. To reason about the telos of a practice—or to argue about it—is, at least in part, to reason or argue about what virtues it should honor and reward. The key to understanding Aristotle’s ethics and politics is to see the force of these two considerations, and the relation between them.",

          "The debate over affirmative action can be recast in terms that echo Aristotle’s account of flutes.",
          "That arguments about universities—and cheerleaders and flutes—naturally proceed in this way bears out Aristotle’s point: Arguments about justice and rights are often arguments about the purpose, or telos, of a social institution, which in turn reflect competing notions of the virtues the institution should honor and reward.",
          "Aristotle believes that it is possible to reason about the purpose of social institutions.",
          "Aristotle offers his most sustained answer to these questions in his discussion of politics.",
          "But Aristotle reminds us that all theories of distributive justice discriminate.",
          "Aristotle doesn’t see it this way. For Aristotle, the purpose of politics is not to set up a framework of rights that is neutral among ends. It is to form good citizens and to cultivate good character.",
          "Aristotle criticizes what he takes to be the two major claimants to political authority—oligarchs and democrats.",

When it is necessary to march out to war, they pay troops and stay at home.",
