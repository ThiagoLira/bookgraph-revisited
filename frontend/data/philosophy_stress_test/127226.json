          "Immanuel Kant, whom Marx called the philosopher of the French (or bourgeois) Revolution, saw the revolutionaries’ will to freedom, despite its contradictions, well-nigh irresistible.",
          "the only great thinker who dared to go against the grain of the question was Immanuel Kant, who boldly explained that the “proverbial saying . . . means in simple language: ‘Justice shall prevail, even though all the rascals in the world should perish as a result.’”",
          "First they became what they had been for Plato only in their relationship to the political realm, standards and measurements, or the regulating, limiting forces of man’s own reasoning mind, as they appear in Kant.",
          "finally inspired Kant’s gigantic effort to re-examine the human faculties",
          "In Kant’s own words: “It will always remain bewildering . . . that the earlier generations seem to carry on their burdensome business only for the sake of the later . . . and that only the last should have the good fortune to dwell in the [completed] building.”36",
          "only in Kant’s reply to Plato: “It is not to be expected that kings philosophize or that philosophers become kings, nor is it to be desired, because the possession of power corrupts the free judgment of reason inevitably”",
          "The greatest clarification in these obscure matters we owe to Kant and to his insight that freedom is no more ascertainable to the inner sense and within the field of inner experience than it is to the senses with which we know and understand the world.",
          "Kant saved freedom from this twofold assault upon it by distinguishing between a “pure” or theoretical reason and a “practical reason” whose center is free will",
          "This attitude of disinterested joy (to use the Kantian term, uninteressiertes Wohlgefallen)",
          "Kant’s categorical imperative, the only competitor in the field, could be stripped of its Judaeo-Christian ingredients...",
          "as Kant said, 'general precepts learned at the feet either of priests or philosophers, or even drawn from one's own resources, are never so efficacious as an example of virtue or holiness.'",
          "The reason, as Kant explains, is that we always need 'intuitions ... to verify the reality of our concepts.'"

In this book she describes the perplexing crises which modern society faces as a result of the loss of meaning of the traditional key words of politics: justice, reason, responsibility, virtue, and glory. Through a series of eight exercises, she shows how we can redistill once more the vital essence of these concepts.",

It examines what can be asserted about anything that exists just because of its existence & not because of any special qualities it has. Also covered are different kinds of causation, form & matter, the existence of mathematical objects, & a prime-mover God.",

          "Their immediate predecessor was Hegel.",
          "When Hegel finally, in a last gigantic effort, had gathered together into one consistent self-developing whole the various strands of traditional philosophy as they had developed from Plato’s original concept",
          "the “reconciliation with reality,” the catharsis, which, according to Aristotle, was the essence of tragedy, and, according to Hegel, was the ultimate purpose of history, came about through the tears of remembrance.",
          "The great impact of the notion of history upon the consciousness of the modern age came relatively late, not before the last third of the eighteenth century, finding with relative quickness its climactic consummation in Hegel’s philosophy.",
          "To think, with Hegel, that truth resides and reveals itself in the time-process itself is characteristic of all modern historical consciousness, however it expresses itself, in specifically Hegelian terms or not.",
          "The central concept of Hegelian metaphysics is history.",
          "whose history Hegel was consequently able to see as one uninterrupted development of the Spirit.",
          "It can be said that Hegel’s transformation of metaphysics into a philosophy of history was preceded by an attempt to get rid of metaphysics for the sake of a philosophy of politics.",
          "It never occurred to either of them [Vico or Hegel] to apply this concept directly by using it as a principle of action.",
          "History—based on the manifest assumption that no matter how haphazard single actions may appear in the present and in their singularity, they inevitably lead to a sequence of events forming a story that can be rendered through intelligible narrative the moment the events are removed into the past—became the great dimension in which men could become \"reconciled\" with reality (Hegel), the reality of human affairs, i.e., of things which owe their existence exclusively to men.",
          "To the extent that the teller of factual truth is also a storyteller, he brings about that “reconciliation with reality” which Hegel, the philosopher of history par excellence, understood as the ultimate goal of all philosophical thought, and which, indeed, has been the secret motor of all historiography that transcends mere learnedness.",

          "The author references Hegel's transformation of metaphysics into a philosophy of history, positioning it as a successor to earlier modern attempts to create a philosophy of politics.",

It is Epictetus, a lame former slave exiled by Emperor Domitian, who offers by far the most precise and humane version of Stoic ideals. The Discourses, assembled by his pupil Arrian, catch him in action, publicly setting out his views on ethical dilemmas.\nCommitted to communicating with the broadest possible audience...",
