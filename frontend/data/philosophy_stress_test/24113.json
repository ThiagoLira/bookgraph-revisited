Starting from a minimal number of axioms, Whitehead and Russell display the structure of both kinds of thought.

His paintings, with their unexpected juxtaposition of objects, are a deliberate defiance of common sense. In this classic study, Suzi Gablik explains how Magritte was never involved in the experimental techniques and stylistic innovations of the other Surrealists, and how, as a result, his work has proved to hold more options for the future. 228 illus., 19 in color.",
