Alwyn Towers, an American expatriate and sometime novelist, is staying with a friend outside of Paris, when a well-heeled, itinerant Irish couple drops in--with Lucy, their trained hawk, a restless, sullen, disturbingly totemic presence. Lunch is prepared, drink flows. A masquerade, at once harrowing and farcical, begins.

The tramps hope that Godot will change their lives for the better. Instead, two eccentric travelers arrive, one man on the end of the other's rope. The results are both funny and dangerous in this existential masterpiece.",

Though the grave has given Cubas the distance to examine his rather undistinguished life, it has not dampened his sense of humor. In the tradition of Laurence Stern's Tristram Shamdy, Epitaph of a Small Winner is one of the wittiest self-portraits in literary history.",

O leitor e maltratado, ha capitulos em branco, outros sem utilidade. Bras Cubas, o improvavel heroi desta historia, nao fez nada de especial. Apaixonou-se por uma mulher casada, falhou uma carreira politica, nunca teve filhos. Depois morreu, e entao escreveu as suas memorias.",

But many critics hailed The Berlin Stories, the reissue of two of his best novels, as his finest. In the book, a man named Christopher Isherwood, who is and is not the author, writes a story of exile, combining the best of Isherwood's real life with the best of the life he imagined.",
