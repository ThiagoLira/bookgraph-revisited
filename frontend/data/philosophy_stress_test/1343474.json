Using Biblical references, dialectics, and ideas from some of the world's greatest thinkers, he confronts believers with his cogent explanation.\nApproaching religion from a humanistic perspective, Feuerbach explores the idea that divinity is an outward projection of our idealistic h...",

Everyone will be compelled to see that which is optically true, is explicable in its own terms, is objective, before he can arrive at any possible subjective position. This will abolish that pictorial and imaginative association pattern which has remained unsuperseded for centuries and which has been stamped upon our vision by great individual painters. We have—through a hundred years of photography and two decades of film—been enormously enriched in this respect. We may say that we see the world with entirely different eyes. Nevertheless, the total result to date amounts to little more than a visual encyclopaedic achievement. This is not enough.

        "description": "Roaming Paris streets by night in the early 1930s, Brassa created arresting images of the city's dramatic nocturnal landscape. First published in French in 1932, this new edition brings one of Brassa's finest works back into print. The back alleys, metro stations, and bistros he photographed are at turns hauntingly empty or peopled by prostitutes, laborers, thugs, and lovers. \"Paris by Night\" is a stunning portrait of nighttime in the City of Light, as captured by its most articulate observer. 62 photos.",

          "The epigraph for a book of Walker Evans’s photographs published by the Museum of Modern Art is a passage from Whitman that sounds the theme of American photography’s most prestigious quest: “I do not doubt but the majesty & beauty of the world are latent in any iota of the world…I do not doubt there is far more in trivialities, insects, vulgar persons, slaves, dwarfs, weeds, rejected refuse, than I have supposed….”",
          "Instead of showing identity between things which are different (Whitman’s democratic vista), everybody is shown to look the same.",

          "the Whitmanesque appetites have turned pious",
          "They might continue to practice the atomistic visual stenography inspired by Whitman.",

          "The author references Whitman as a source of cultural and aesthetic ideals in photography, noting a shift from his affirmative vision to a more pious or patronizing stance.",
          "The author describes how photographers adopted a fragmented, detailed style of visual documentation inspired by Whitman's approach.",
          "The author contrasts later photographers' work with Whitman's ability to synthesize and unify, attributing to him a capacity for cohesive vision that was lost.",
