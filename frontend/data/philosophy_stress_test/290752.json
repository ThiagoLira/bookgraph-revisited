          "being well aware that you do not need to have Plutarch and his companions interpreted to you",
          "I send you the Consolatory Letter written by Plutarch to his Wife, translated by him into French",
          "For Pompey could pardon the whole city of the Mamertines, though furiously incensed against it, upon the single account of the virtue and magnanimity of one citizen, Zeno,—[Plutarch calls him Stheno, and also Sthemnus and Sthenis]—who took the fault of the public wholly upon himself; neither entreated other favour, but alone to undergo the punishment for all: and yet Sylla’s host, having in the city of Perugia —[Plutarch says Preneste, a town of Latium.]—manifested the same virtue, obtained nothing by it, either for himself or his fellow-citizens.",
          "Plutarch says of those who are delighted with little dogs and monkeys, that the amorous part that is in us, for want of a legitimate object, rather than lie idle, does after that manner forge and create one false and frivolous.",
          "Though the ancient poet in Plutarch tells us— “Point ne se faut couroucer aux affaires, Il ne leur chault de toutes nos choleres.” [“We must not trouble the gods with our affairs; they take no heed of our angers and disputes.”—Plutarch.]",
          "witness the jeer Archidamus put upon Pertander, \"that he had quitted the glory of being an excellent physician to gain the repute of a very bad poet.—[Plutarch, Apoth. of the Lacedaemonians, 'in voce' Archidamus.]",
          "—[Plutarch, Life of Cicero, c. 22:]—for, provided there was any mention of life in the case, though past, it carried yet some sound of consolation.",
          "Paulus Emilius answered him whom the miserable King of Macedon, his prisoner, sent to entreat him that he would not lead him in his triumph, \"Let him make that request to himself.\"—[ Plutarch, Life of Paulus Aemilius, c. 17; Cicero, Tusc., v. 40.]",
          "Plutarch would say of what he has delivered to us, that it is the work of others: that his examples are all and everywhere exactly true: that they are useful to posterity, and are presented with a lustre that will light us the way to virtue, is his own work.",
          "which Alexander much more vividly and more roundly manifested in effect, when, having notice by a letter from Parmenio, that Philip, his most beloved physician, was by Darius’ money corrupted to poison him, at the same time he gave the letter to Philip to read, drank off the potion he had brought him.",
          "for Plutarch says that Greek and Scholar were terms of reproach and contempt amongst the Romans.",
          "I never seriously settled myself to the reading any book of solid learning but Plutarch and Seneca; and there, like the Danaides, I eternally fill, and it as constantly runs out; something of which drops upon this paper, but little or nothing stays with me.",
          "Alexandridas justly reproached him who made very good. but too long speeches to the Ephori, when he said: \"O stranger! thou speakest the things thou shouldst speak, but not as thou shouldst speak them.\"—[Plutarch, Apothegms of the Lacedamonians.]",
          "Demetrius the grammarian finding in the temple of Delphos a knot of philosophers set chatting together, said to them,—[Plutarch, Treatise on Oracles which have ceased]—",
          "I am of Plutarch’s mind, that Aristotle did not so much trouble his great disciple with the knack of forming syllogisms, or with the elements of geometry; as with infusing into him good precepts concerning valour, prowess, magnanimity, temperance, and the contempt of fear;",
          "But what if Plutarch, besides several examples that he produces out of antiquity, tells us, he knows of certain knowledge, that in the time of Domitian, the news of the battle lost by Antony in Germany was published at Rome, many days' journey from thence, and dispersed throughout the whole world, the same day it was fought...",
          "and that other, that Plutarch endeavoured to reconcile to his brother: “I make never the more account of him,” said he, “for coming out of the same hole.”",
          "The kings of Persia were wont to invite their wives to the beginning of their festivals; but when the wine began to work in good earnest, and that they were to give the reins to pleasure, they sent them back to their private apartments, that they might not participate in their immoderate lust, sending for other women in their stead, with whom they were not obliged to so great a decorum of respect.—[Plutarch, Precepts of Marriage, c. 14.]",
          "When King Pyrrhus invaded Italy, having viewed and considered the order of the army the Romans sent out to meet him; “I know not,” said he, “what kind of barbarians” (for so the Greeks called all other nations) “these may be; but the disposition of this army that I see has nothing of barbarism in it.”—[Plutarch, Life of Pyrrhus, c. 8.]",
          "as Plutarch complains, that in his time some attributed the cause of the younger Cato’s death to his fear of Caesar, at which he seems very angry, and with good reason;",
          "Plutarch says, moreover, that to appear so excellent in these less necessary qualities is to produce witness against a man’s self, that he has spent his time and applied his study ill, which ought to have been employed in the acquisition of more necessary and more useful things.",
          "insomuch that Brutus had much difficulty in saving a very small number.—[\"Only fifty were saved.\"—Plutarch, Life of Brutus, c. 8.]",
          "Plutarch says somewhere that he does not find so great a difference betwixt beast and beast as he does betwixt man and man; which he says in reference to the internal qualities and perfections of the soul.",
          "Nay, perhaps he would be of King Seleucus’ opinion, that he who knew the weight of a sceptre would not stoop to pick it up, if he saw it lying before him, so great and painful are the duties incumbent upon a good king.—[Plutarch, If a Sage should Meddle with Affairs of Stale, c. 12.]",
          "It seemed a little harsh and rough at first; but already custom, by the authority of his Plutarch, has overcome that novelty.",
          "Of this nature was his employment who made it his business to compute into how many several orders the letters of the alphabet might be transposed, and found out that incredible number mentioned in Plutarch.",
          "It has been reported of some, as of Alexander the Great, that their sweat exhaled an odoriferous smell, occasioned by some rare and extraordinary constitution, of which Plutarch and others have been inquisitive into the cause.",
          "Even our great Plutarch, that excellent and perfect judge of human actions, when he sees Brutus and Torquatus kill their children, begins to doubt whether virtue could proceed so far, and to question whether these persons had not rather been stimulated by some other passion.—[Plutarch, Life of Publicola, c. 3.]",
          "I was just now reading this passage where Plutarch says of himself, that Rusticus being present at a declamation of his at Rome, there received a packet from the emperor, and deferred to open it till all was done: for which, says he, all the company highly applauded the gravity of this person.",
          "And this very Plutarch has given me to understand, that Julius Caesar had preserved himself, if, going to the Senate the day he was assassinated by the conspirators, he had read a note which was presented to him by, the way.",
          "He tells also the story of Archias, the tyrant of Thebes, that the night before the execution of the design Pelopidas had plotted to kill him to restore his country to liberty, he had a full account sent him in writing by another Archias, an Athenian, of the whole conspiracy, and that, this packet having been delivered to him while he sat at supper, he deferred the opening of it, saying, which afterwards turned to a proverb in Greece, “Business to-morrow.”",
          "This place might naturally enough admit of some discourse upon the consideration of valour, and the difference of this virtue from others; but, Plutarch having so often handled this subject, I should give myself an unnecessary trouble to repeat what he has said.",
          "Plutarch says, that Demetrius caused two complete suits of armour to be made for himself and for Alcimus, a captain of the greatest note and authority about him, of six score pounds weight each, whereas the ordinary suits weighed but half as much.",
          "the books that serve me to this purpose are Plutarch, since he has been translated into French, and Seneca.",
          "there to fix habitations and human abodes, and plant colonies for our convenience, as Plato and Plutarch have done?",
          "I must not omit what Plutarch says he saw of a dog at Rome with the Emperor Vespasian, the father, at the theatre of Marcellus.",
          "But this other story of the pie, of which we have Plutarch himself for a warrant, is very strange.",
          "I will not omit this other example of a dog, also, which the same Plutarch (I am sadly confounding all order, but I do not propose arrangement here any more than elsewhere throughout my book) which Plutarch says he saw on board a ship.",
          "for this saying (out of Plutarch) has in all times been in the mouth of these people: “Keep warm thy feet and head, as to the rest, live like a beast.”",
          "Plutarch delivers this story for a certain truth, and that it happened in the age wherein he lived.",
          "Plutarch, who has seen and handled many of them, thinks it is the bones of some fish which she joins and binds together, interlacing them, some lengthwise and others across, and adding ribs and hoops in such manner that she forms at last a round vessel fit to launch;",
          "Plutarch says the same of metaphysics.",
          "Is not the same thing seen in Seneca and Plutarch?",
          "Plutarch gives a like example of some one who would not be satisfied in that whereof he was in doubt, that he might not lose the pleasure of inquiring into it;",
          "\"Tis a greater presumption,\" says Plutarch, \"in them who are but men to attempt to speak and discourse of the gods and demi-gods than it is in a man utterly ignorant of music to give an opinion of singing; or in a man who never saw a camp to dispute about arms and martial affairs, presuming by some light conjecture to understand the effects of an art he is totally a stranger to.\"",
          "And if it be true, as Plutarch says, that in some place of the Indies there are men without mouths",
          "The extremities of our perquisition do all fall into astonishment and blindness; as Plutarch says of the testimony of histories, that, according to charts and maps, the utmost bounds of known r countries are taken up with marshes, impenetrable forests, deserts, and uninhabitable places;",
          "There are others, even among ourselves, who have believed that devils were made of the souls of the damned; as Plutarch thinks that gods were made of those that were saved; for there are few things which that author is so positive in as he is in this; maintaining elsewhere a doubtful and ambiguous way of expression.",
          "Whatever I undertake, I owe a sacrifice to the Graces, as Plutarch says of some one, to conciliate their favour: \"Si quid enim placet, Si quid dulce horninum sensibus influit, Debentur lepidis omnia Gratiis.\" [\"If anything please that I write, if it infuse delight into men's minds, all is due to the charming Graces.\" The verses are probably by some modern poet.]",
          "and though my inclination would rather prompt me to imitate Seneca's way of writing, yet I do nevertheless more esteem that of Plutarch.",
          "And as Bias cried out to a wicked fellow, “I know that sooner or later thou wilt have thy reward, but I am afraid I shall not see it”; —[Plutarch, on the Delay in Divine Justice, c. 2.]",
          "Plutarch is admirable throughout, but especially where he judges of human actions. What fine things does he say in the comparison of Lycurgus and Numa upon the subject of our great folly in abandoning children to the care and government of their fathers?",
          "Plutarch’s writings, if well understood, sufficiently bespeak their author, and so that I think I know him even into his soul; and yet I could wish that we had some fuller account of his life.",
          "Let us now come to Plutarch: Jean Bodin is a good author of our times... where he accuses Plutarch not only of ignorance... but that he 'often writes things incredible, and absolutely fabulous'...",
          "The other example he introduces of “things incredible and wholly fabulous,” delivered by Plutarch",
          "This singular and particular commendation is also left of him in the judgment of Plutarch, that he is the only author in the world that never glutted nor disgusted his readers, presenting himself always another thing, and always flourishing in some new grace.",
          "As to his knowledge, we have this ancient judgment of him, “That never any man knew so much, and spake so little as he”;—[Plutarch, On the Demon of Socrates, c. 23. ]—for he was of the Pythagorean sect;",
          "What a matter! what a workman! For a man that was no saint, but, as we say, a gentleman, of civilian and ordinary manners, and of a moderate ambition, the richest life that I know, and full of the richest and most to be desired parts, all things considered, is, in my opinion, that of Alcibiades. But as to what concerns Epaminondas, I will here, for the example of an excessive goodness, add some of his opinions: he declared, that the greatest satisfaction he ever had in his whole life, was the contentment he gave his father and mother by his victory at Leuctra; wherein his deference is great, preferring their pleasure before his own, so dust and so full of so glorious an action.",
          "He kept his family in health, as Plutarch says if I mistake not, with hare’s milk;",
          "as the Lacedaemonians did,—[Plutarch, Difference between a Flatterer and a Friend, c. 21. ]—having been defeated by Antipater, when just upon concluding an agreement: \"You may impose as heavy and ruinous taxes upon us as you please, but to command us to do shameful and dishonest things, you will lose your time, for it is to no purpose.\"",
          "Even Plutarch himself laments his daughter for the little apish tricks of her infancy.—[Consolation to his Wife on the Death of their Daughter, c. I.]",
          "“Ceux qui par trop fuyant Venus estrivent, Faillent autant que ceulx qui trop la suyvent.” [“They err as much who too much forbear Venus, as they who are too frequent in her rites.”—A translation by Amyot from Plutarch, A philosopher should converse with princes.]",
          "some air of the foolish Plutarch makes mention",
          "Pittacus used to say,—[Plutarch, On Contentment, c. II. ]— that every one had his trouble, and that his was the jealous head of his wife; but for which he should think himself perfectly happy.",
          "Plutarch says’ that he sees the Latin tongue by the things:",
          "But I can hardly be without Plutarch; he is so universal and so full, that upon all occasions, and what extravagant subject soever you take in hand, he will still be at your elbow, and hold out to you a liberal and not to be exhausted hand of riches and embellishments.",
          "and the reason why the sophist Bion so pleasantly called the first appearing hairs of adolescence 'Aristogitons' and 'Harmodiuses'—[Plutarch, On Love, c.34. ]— is sufficiently known.",
          "I think I have seen in Plutarch’ (who of all the authors I know, is he who has best mixed art with nature, and judgment with knowledge), his giving as a reason for the, rising of the stomach in those who are at sea, that it is occasioned by fear",
          "Neither ought we to set suspicion against evidence; and therefore I do not believe Plutarch in this matter.",
          "As Plutarch says, that those who, through false shame, are soft and facile to grant whatever is desired of them, are afterwards as facile to break their word and to recant; so he who enters lightly into a quarrel is apt to go as lightly out of it.",
          "Plutarch’s way, by how much it is more disdainful and farther stretched, is, in my opinion, so much more manly and persuasive: and I am apt to believe that his soul had more assured and more regular motions.",
          "Or thus—for Plutarch delivers it both these ways, as he does a thousand other things, variously and contradictorily—“He must needs be good, because he is so even to the wicked.”",
          "To attempt to combat natural necessity, is to represent the folly of Ctesiphon, who undertook to kick with his mule.—[Plutarch, How to restrain Anger, c. 8.]"

          "And of Cicero himself, who stood indebted to his learning for all he was worth, Valerius says, \"That he began to disrelish letters in his old age; and when at his studies, it was with great independency upon any one party; following what he thought probable, now in one sect, and then in another, evermore wavering under the doubts of the academy.\"",
          "Hear Cicero’s protestation, who expounds to us another’s fancy by his own: Qui requirunt quid de quque re ipsi sentiamus, curiosius id faciunt quam necesse est,... Hoc in philosophi ratio, contra omnia disserendi, nuttamque rem aperte judicandi, profecta a Socrate, repetita ab Arcesila, conjirmata a Gameade, usqu ad nostram viget cetatem..........Hi sumus, qui omnibus veris falsa quodam adjuncta esse dicamus, tanta similitudine, ut in iis nulla insit certe judicandi et assentiendi nota.",

          "I am astonished at the great liberty allowed by Xenophon in such cases, and that both by precept and by the example of several exploits of his complete emperor; an author of very great authority, I confess, in those affairs, as being in his own person both a great captain and a philosopher of the first form of Socrates’ disciples",
          "In that excellent institution that Xenophon attributes to the Persians, we find that they taught their children virtue, as other nations do letters.",
          "Astyages, in Xenophon, asks Cyrus to give an account of his last lesson; and thus it was, “A great boy in our school, having a little short cassock, by force took a longer from another that was not so tall as he, and gave him his own in exchange: whereupon I, being appointed judge of the controversy, gave judgment, that I thought it best each should keep the coat he had, for that they both of them were better fitted with that of one another than with their own: upon which my master told me, I had done ill, in that I had only considered the fitness of the garments, whereas I ought to have considered the justice of the thing, which required that no one should have anything forcibly taken from him that is his own.”",
          "if he embrace the opinions of Xenophon and Plato, by his own reason, they will no more be theirs, but become his own.",
          "—“No, truly, sir,” said he, “but I would give him with all my heart, to get thereby a true friend, could I find out any man worthy of that alliance.”—[Xenophon, Cyropadia, viii. 3.]",
          "though some parts of it are more excusable than the rest, as the care of gardens, which Xenophon attributes to Cyrus",
          "If the acts of Xenophon and Caesar had not far transcended their eloquence, I scarce believe they would ever have taken the pains to have written them; they made it their business to recommend not their speaking, but their doing.",

          "Xenophon tells us, that the Assyrians were fain to keep their horses fettered in the stable, they were so fierce and vicious",
          "There is, as I remember, a passage in Xenophon where he tells us that we ought so much the more seldom to call upon God, by how much it is hard to compose our souls to such a degree of calmness, patience, and devotion as it ought to be in at such a time;",
          "Xenophon reports a like perplexity in Socrates’s doctrine;",
          "“I do not believe,” says he, “that Xenophon himself, if he were now living, though he were allowed to write whatever pleased him to the advantage of Agesilaus, would dare to bring them into comparison.”",
          "following the advice of Cyrus in Xenophon",
          "According to the saying of Cyrus in Xenophon, \"'Tis not the number of men, but the number of good men, that gives the advantage\": the remainder serving rather to trouble than assist.",
          "Xenophon lays it for an objection and an accusation against Menon, that he never made love to any but old women.",
          "I am of opinion that in, Plato and Xenophon Socrates disputes more in favour of the disputants than in favour of the dispute",
          "I am more devout in good than in evil fortune, according to the precept of Xenophon, if not according to his reason;",
          "as Xenophon reports they did",
          "Imagine this in Xenophon, related as a fine commendation of Agesilaus: that, being entreated by a neighbouring prince with whom he had formerly had war, to permit him to pass through his country, he granted his request, giving him free passage through Peloponnesus; and not only did not imprison or poison him, being at his mercy, but courteously received him according to the obligation of his promise, without doing him the least injury or offence.",

          "and he who demanded of Crates, how long it was necessary to philosophise, received this answer: “Till our armies are no more commanded by fools.” —[Diogenes Laertius, vi.\n92.\n]",

          "This also was the meaning of the philosopher Antisthenes, when he pleasantly said, that “men should furnish themselves with such things as would float, and might with the owner escape the storm”;—[Diogenes Laertius, vi. 6.]",
          "Thales advised him quite contrary, bidding him swear to shield the greater fault by the less; [Montaigne’s memory here serves him ill, for the question being put to Thales, his answer was: \"But is not perjury worse than adultery?\"—Diogenes Laertius, in vita, i. 36.]",

The question was whether a wise man could love him. Cotton has \"Emonez, a young courtezan of Chios.\"]",
          "And therefore Diogenes, who passed away his time in rolling himself in his tub, and made nothing of the great Alexander, esteeming us no better than flies or bladders puffed up with wind, was a sharper and more penetrating, and, consequently in my opinion, a juster judge than Timon, surnamed the Man-hater",

They do not much care what mischief they do, since it turns to their own profit. In earnest, they have reason to require a very favourable belief from their patients; and, indeed, it ought to be a very easy one, to swallow things so hard to be believed.

          "Let Cicero, the father of eloquence, treat of the contempt of death; let Seneca do the same: the first languishingly drawls it out so you perceive he would make you resolve upon a thing on which he is not resolved himself; he inspires you not with courage, for he himself has none; the other animates and inflames you.",

          "Let us not forget Aristotle, who held the soul to be that which naturally causes the body to move, which he calls entelechia, with as cold an invention as any of the rest; for he neither speaks of the essence, nor of the original, nor of the nature of the soul, but only takes notice of the effect",

He who is now digging in my garden, has this morning buried his father or his son. The very names by which they call diseases sweeten and mollify the sharpness of them: the phthisic is with them no more than a cough, dysentery but a looseness, the pleurisy but a stitch; and, as they gently name them, so they patiently endure them; they are very great and grievous indeed when they hinder their ordinary labour; they never keep their beds but to die: “Simplex illa et aperta virtus in obscuram et solertem scientiam versa est.” [“That overt and simple virtue is converted into an obscure and subtle science.”—Seneca, Ep., 95.]",

          "and Isocrates pleases me when he instructs Nicocles not to envy princes who have large dominions, but those who know how to preserve those which have fallen into their hands",
          "and now exists only in certain vestiges of antiquity",
          "To him that told Socrates, \"The thirty tyrants have sentenced thee to death\"; \"And nature them,\" said he.—[Socrates was not condemned to death by the thirty tyrants, but by the Athenians.-Diogenes Laertius, ii.35.]",
          "a divine work, according to Socrates; and love, the desire of immortality, and himself an immortal demon.",
          "Socrates, and since him Arcesilaus, made first their scholars speak, and then they spoke to them",
          "For my part, I hold, and Socrates commands it, that whoever has in his mind a sprightly and clear imagination, he will express it well enough in one kind of tongue or another",
          "and Socrates thinks it worthy a father’s care to give fine names to his children.",
          "Socrates and Plato “an art to flatter and deceive.”",
          "We read of Socrates, that though he never departed from Athens during the frequent plagues that infested the city, he only was never infected.",
          "considering that the Gentiles expressly forbad Socrates, Plato, and the other sages to inquire into or so much as mention the things committed to the priests of Delphi;",
          "As Socrates said that the principal office of wisdom was to distinguish good from evil",
          "Of what does Socrates treat more largely than of himself?",
          "Because Socrates had alone digested to purpose the precept of his god, “to know himself,” and by that study arrived at the perfection of setting himself at nought, he only was reputed worthy the title of a sage.",
          "I am come thus far at my ease; but here it comes into my head that the soul of Socrates, the most perfect that ever came to my knowledge, should by this rule be of very little recommendation; for I cannot conceive in that person any the least motion of a vicious inclination: I cannot imagine there could be any difficulty or constraint in the course of his virtue: I know his reason to be so powerful and sovereign over him that she would never have suffered a vicious appetite so much as to spring in him.",
          "And who, that has his brain never so little tinctured with the true philosophy, can be content to imagine Socrates only free from fear and passion in the accident of his prison, fetters, and condemnation?",
          "Socrates confessed to some who had discovered a certain inclination to vice in his physiognomy, that it was, in truth, his natural propension, but that he had by discipline corrected it.",
          "As the virtuous actions of Socrates and Cato remain vain and fruitless, for not having had the love and obedience to the true creator of all things,",
          "Unless we shall also think fit, as even Socrates does, to add to the counterpoise that notable prerogative above beasts, That whereas nature has prescribed them certain seasons and limits for the delights of Venus, she has given us the reins at all hours and all seasons.",
          "After that Socrates was told that the god of wisdom had assigned to him the title of sage, he was astonished at it, and, searching and examining himself throughout, could find no foundation for this divine judgment.",
          "profecta a Socrate, repetita ab Arcesila, conjirmata a Gameade, usqu ad nostram viget cetatem..........",
          "and Socrates of them all, excepting that which treats of manners and of life.",
          "Socrates, the conductor of his dialogues, is eternally upon questions and stirring up disputes, never determining, never satisfying, and professes to have no other science but that of opposing himself.",
          "Socrates in Xenophon, concerning this affair, says of Anaxagoras, reputed by antiquity learned above all others in celestial and divine matters, “That he had cracked his brain, as all other men do who too immoderately search into knowledges which nothing belong to them:”",
          "As Socrates says, in Plato, “That whoever meddles with philosophy may be reproached as Thales was by the woman, that he sees nothing of that which is before him.",
          "the slaver of a contemptible cur shed upon the hand of Socrates, to shake all his wisdom and all his great and regulated imaginations, and so to annihilate them,",
          "and therefore it was that Socrates only begged of the gods that they would give him what they knew to be best for him",
          "is generally for every one to obey the laws of his country, as was the advice of Socrates, inspired, as he says, by a divine counsel;",
          "Socrates’s wife exasperated her grief by this circumstance: \"Oh, how unjustly do these wicked judges put him to death!\" \"Why,\" replied he, \"hadst thou rather they should execute me justly?\"",
          "Socrates says, that some god tried to mix in one mass and to confound pain and pleasure, but not being able to do it; he bethought him at least to couple them by the tail.",
          "In observing the wisdom of Socrates, and many circumstances of his condemnation, I should dare to believe that he in some sort himself purposely, by collusion, contributed to it, seeing that, at the age of seventy years, he might fear to suffer the lofty motions of his mind to be cramped and his wonted lustre obscured.",
          "\"according to what a man can,\" was the favourite sentence and motto of Socrates.",
          "'tis for men of the first form of knowledge purely to insist upon the thing, to consider and judge it; it appertains to one sole Socrates to meet death with an ordinary countenance, to grow acquainted with it, and to sport with it; he seeks no consolation out of the thing itself; dying appears to him a natural and indifferent accident; 'tis there that he fixes his sight and resolution, without looking elsewhere.",
          "Socrates being asked, whether it was more commodious to take a wife or not, “Let a man take which course he will,” said he; “he will repent.”",
          "According to Socrates, love is the appetite of generation by the mediation of beauty.",
          "kisses, which Socrates says are so powerful and dangerous for the stealing of hearts, of no esteem.",
          "That Socrates always received smilingly the contradictions offered to his arguments, a man may say arose from his strength of reason;",
          "and Socrates is of opinion that whoever should find himself, his son, and a stranger guilty of any violence and wrong, ought to begin with himself, present himself first to the sentence of justice, and implore, to purge himself, the assistance of the hand of the executioner",
          "and the weak ones, says Socrates, corrupt the dignity of philosophy in the handling, it appears useless and vicious, when lodged in an ill-contrived mind.",
          "Not because Socrates has said so, but because it is in truth my own humour",
          "What Socrates did towards his end, to look upon a sentence of banishment as worse than a sentence of death against him",
          "Socrates, seeing a great quantity of riches, jewels, and furniture carried in pomp through his city: \"How many things,\" said he, \"I do not desire!\"—[Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., V. 32.]",
          "Socrates does not say: \"Do not surrender to the charms of beauty; stand your ground, and do your utmost to oppose it.\" \"Fly it,\" says he; \"shun the fight and encounter of it, as of a powerful poison that darts and wounds at a distance.\"",
          "That image of Socrates’ discourses, which his friends have transmitted to us, we approve upon no other account than a reverence to public sanction",
          "Socrates makes his soul move a natural and common motion: a peasant said this; a woman said that; he has never anybody in his mouth but carters, joiners, cobblers, and masons; his are inductions and similitudes drawn from the most common and known actions of men; every one understands him.",
          "Socrates shall be one; for, as I remember, he speaks something to this purpose to the judges who sat upon his life and death. [That which follows is taken from the Apology of Socrates in Plato, chap. 17, &c.]",
          "Besides, the method of arguing, of which Socrates here makes use, is it not equally admirable both in simplicity and vehemence?",
          "a ridiculous fruit of learning, that Socrates so pleasantly discusses against Euthydemus.",
          "Socrates was a perfect exemplar in all great qualities, and I am vexed that he had so deformed a face and body as is said, and so unsuitable to the beauty of his soul, himself being so amorous and such an admirer of beauty: Nature did him wrong.",
          "I have not, as Socrates did, corrected my natural composition by the force of reason",
          "That reason which strengthens Socrates from his vicious bend renders him obedient to the gods and men of authority in his city: courageous in death, not because his soul is immortal, but because he is mortal.",
          "Socrates asked Menon, “What virtue was.” “There is,” says Menon, “the virtue of a man and of a woman, of a magistrate and of a private person, of an old man and of a child.” “Very fine,” cried Socrates, “we were in quest of one virtue, and thou hast brought us a whole swarm.”",
          "So in this, \"of knowing a man's self,\" that every man is seen so resolved and satisfied with himself, that every man thinks himself sufficiently intelligent, signifies that every one knows nothing about the matter; as Socrates gives Euthydemus to understand.",
          "and he might have learned it of Socrates, who, advising his disciples to be solicitous of their health as a chief study, added that it was hard if a man of sense, having a care to his exercise and diet, did not better know than any physician what was good or ill for him.",
          "When Socrates, after his fetters were knocked off, felt the pleasure of that itching which the weight of them had caused in his legs, he rejoiced to consider the strict alliance betwixt pain and pleasure; how they are linked together by a necessary connection, so that by turns they follow and mutually beget one another; and cried out to good AEsop, that he ought out of this consideration to have taken matter for a fine fable.",
          "there are wonderful instances of it that Socrates, Xenophon, and Aristotle, men of irreproachable authority, relate.",
          "Socrates one that was all conduct and action; Plato found a mean betwixt the two; but they only say this for the sake of talking. The true temperament is found in Socrates;"

          "Witness the younger Cato: When I see him die, and tearing out his own bowels, I am not satisfied simply to believe that he had then his soul totally exempt from all trouble and horror: I cannot think that he only maintained himself in the steadiness that the Stoical rules prescribed him; temperate, without emotion, and imperturbed.",
          "That censor and reprover of others, Cato, was reproached that he was a hard drinker",
          "insomuch that Cato, who ever disdained death and fortune, could not endure the sight of a looking-glass, or of water, overwhelmed with horror and affright at the thought of falling, by the contagion of a mad dog, into the disease called by physicians hydrophobia:",
          "Of this here is an honourable testimony of the elder Cato: “Huic versatile ingenium sic pariter ad omnia fuit, ut natum ad id unum diceres, quodcumque ageret.” [“His parts were so pliable to all uses, that one would say he had been born only to that which he was doing.”—Livy, xxxix. 49.]",
          "for in Cato ‘tis most manifest that ‘tis a procedure extended far beyond the common ways of men: in the brave exploits of his life, and in his death, we find him always mounted upon the great horse",
          "from these nature every day extracts effects of constancy and patience, more pure and manly than those we so inquisitively study in the schools: how many do I ordinarily see who slight poverty? how many who desire to die, or who die without alarm or regret? He who is now digging in my garden, has this morning buried his father or his son. The very names by which they call diseases sweeten and mollify the sharpness of them: the phthisic is with them no more than a cough, dysentery but a looseness, the pleurisy but a stitch; and, as they gently name them, so they patiently endure them; they are very great and grievous indeed when they hinder their ordinary labour; they never keep their beds but to die: “Simplex illa et aperta virtus in obscuram et solertem scientiam versa est.” [“That overt and simple virtue is converted into an obscure and subtle science.”—Seneca, Ep., 95.]"
