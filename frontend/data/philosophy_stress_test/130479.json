          "Note also that Jacques Lacan, from a quite different starting point, came long ago to a similar appreciation of the inevitable role of irrationality in modern mathematics: If you’ll permit me to use one of those formulas which come to me as I write my notes, human life could be defined as a calculus in which zero was irrational. This formula is just an image, a mathematical metaphor. When I say “irrational,” I’m referring not to some unfathomable emotional state but precisely to what is called an imaginary number. The square root of minus one doesn’t correspond to anything that is subject to our intuition, anything real—in the mathematical sense of the term—and yet, it must be conserved, along with its full function.

          "[T]he first step in our criticism of customary concepts ... (Feyerabend 1993, pp. 52–53)",

          "For example, in 1992 he wrote: How can an enterprise [science] depend on culture in so many ways, and yet produce such solid results?… Most answers to this question are either incomplete or incoherent. Physicists take the fact for granted. Movements that view quantum mechanics as a turning-point in thought—and that include fly-by-night mystics, prophets of a New Age, and relativists of all sorts—get aroused by the cultural component and forget predictions and technology. (Feyerabend 1992, p. 29)",
          "For example, he writes: “Imre Lakatos, somewhat jokingly, called me an anarchist and I had no objection to putting on the anarchist’s mask.” (Feyerabend 1993, p. vii)",
          "For example: “the main ideas of [this] essay … are rather trivial and appear trivial when expressed in suitable terms. I prefer more paradoxical formulations, however, for nothing dulls the mind as thoroughly as hearing familiar words and slogans.” (Feyerabend 1993, p. xiv)",
          "And also: “Always remember that the demonstrations and the rhetorics used do not express any ‘deep convictions’ of mine. They merely show how easy it is to lead people by the nose in a rational way. An anarchist is like an undercover agent who plays the game of Reason in order to undercut the authority of Reason (Truth, Honesty, Justice, and so on).” (Feyerabend 1993, p. 23)",
          "see, for example his claims concerning Brownian motion (Feyerabend 1993, pp. 27–29), renormalization (p. 46), the orbit of Mercury (pp. 47–49), and scattering in quantum mechanics (pp. 49–50n).",

Many definitions of postmodernism focus on its nature as the aftermath of the modern industrial age when technology developed. This book extends that analysis to postmodernism by looking at the status of science, technology, and the arts, the significance of technocracy, and the way the flow of information is controlled in...",

Feyerabend argues that scientific advances can only be understood in a historical context. He looks at the way the philosophy of science has consistently overemphasized practice over method, and considers the possibility that anarchism could replace rationalism in the theory of knowledge.",
