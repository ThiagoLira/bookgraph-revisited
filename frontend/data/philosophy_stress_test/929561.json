Mauthner was the first philosopher to devote himself to the problems raised by ordinary language. Among his Borgesian beliefs were: the self cannot be found and therefore self-knowledge is impossible; psychology does not exist because language can only describe exterior sense impressions; today’s religion is yesterday’s science; morals are not a possible subject matter of knowledge; truth is historically relative; ordinary philosophy is afflicted by “word superstition,” the belief that reality can be known through language; and language is most suitable for poetry or the expression of religious feelings for there the question of truth or falsity does not arise.",

The work relates the tale of the young Arthur Gordon Pym who stows away aboard a whaling ship called Grampus.

No man has ever lived in the past, and none will live in the future; the present alone is the form of all life, and is its sure possession which can never be taken from it. . . We might compare time to a constantly revolving sphere; the half that was always sinking would be the past, that which was always rising would be the future; but the indivisible point at the top, where the tangent touches, would be the extensionless present. As the tangent does not revolve with the sphere, neither does the present, the point of contact of the object, the form of which is time, with the subject, which has no form, because it does not belong to the knowable, but is the condition of all that is knowable” (Welt als Wille und Vorstellung, I, 54)."

Even children and village women know that the unicorn constitutes a favorable presage. But this animal does not figure among the domestic beasts, it is not always easy to find, it does not lend itself to classification. It is not like the horse or the bull, the wolf or the deer. In such conditions, we could be face to face with a unicorn and not know for certain what it was.

          "By contrast, the estimable work of Chesterton, that prototype of physical and moral health, is always on the point of becoming a nightmare.",
          "Hopes and utopias aside, perhaps the most lucid words written about language are these by Chesterton: \"Man knows that there are in the soul tints more bewildering, more numberless, and more nameless than the colors of an autumn forest. . . . Yet he seriously believes that these things can every one of them, in all their tones and semi-tones, in all their blends and unions, be accurately represented by an arbitrary system of grunts and squeals. He believes that an ordinary civilized stockbroker can really produce out of his own inside noises which denote all the mysteries of memory and all the agonies of desire\" (G. F. Watts [1904], 88).",
          "we might think of Chesterton’s Manalive, who is a visible mountain of simplicity and an abyss of divine wisdom",
