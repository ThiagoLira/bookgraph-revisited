In the company of his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, his exploits blossom in all sorts of wonderful ways. While Quixote's fancy often leads him astray - he tilts at windmills, imagining them to be giants - Sancho acquires cunning and a certain sagacity. Sane madman and wise fool, they roam the world together, and together they have haunted readers' imaginations for nearly four hundred year...",

Intentia autorului a fost de a reconstitui trecutul nu ca durata consumata, ci ca exercitiu de percepere afectiva a consistentei unei etape.

          "Shakespeare’s politics, insofar as we can pin them down, do not appear to be very different from those of his Coriolanus",
          "Education founded upon the Iliad, the Bible, Plato, and Shakespeare remains, in some strained form, our ideal",
          "Shakespeare’s own politics may or may not be those of Coriolanus, just as Shakespeare’s anxieties may or may not be those of Hamlet or of Lear.",
          "Most simply, the Canon is Plato and Shakespeare; it is the image of the individual thinking, whether it be Socrates thinking through his own dying, or Hamlet contemplating that undiscovered country.",
          "Milton rather possessively refers to his forerunner as “my Shakespeare,”",
          "The real Stratfordian wrote thirty-eight plays in twenty-four years and then went home to die.",
          "the era of Shakespeare is also the era of Spain.",
          "The influence of Shakespeare on our Chaotic Age remains persuasive, particularly on Joyce and Beckett.",
          "Shakespeare can as truly be seen as having invented the emotive and cognitive irony of ambivalence that governs Freud.",
          "Universality is the authentic aspect of only a handful of Western writers: Shakespeare, Dante, Cervantes, perhaps Tolstoy.",
          "Shakespeare, with Don Quixote, continues to center the Canon for more general readers.",
          "Chaucer and Shakespeare bestow upon us: characters who change",
          "Shakespeare was at once the source of Milton’s authentic if hidden poetic anxiety and, paradoxically, the engenderer of Milton’s canonicity.",
          "Shakespeare unfolds Iago and Macbeth before us",
          "Johnson on Shakespeare is never subtler than in his comment on the Duke’s astonishing “Be absolute for death” speech in act 3, scene 1 of Measure for Measure",
          "E. R. Curtius’s Goethe is the perfecter and final representative of the literary culture that goes from Homer through Virgil to Dante and that achieved later sublimity in Shakespeare, Cervantes, Milton, and Racine.",
          "Shakespeare, whom Goethe genially (and realistically) set above himself, is not quite as dominant an influence upon Part Two as he is upon Part One, which doubtless helps to account for the flood of classical characters, stories, and forms that surges through Part Two.",
          "Goethe’s most profound debt to Shakespeare was the pragmatic realization that apotheosis can be dramatically persuasive.",
          "Faust, Part One is a continuous parody of Shakespeare, with touches of Calderón and Milton added on.",
          "Wordsworth in any case is a beginning, though like all great writers he was haunted by heroic precursors, Milton and Shakespeare beyond all others.",
          "Perhaps Lear dies blasted by the mad hope that Cordelia lives, rather than by realistic despair that she is dead; but Shakespeare seems content to leave the matter equivocal.",

          "No other novel in English invents so much, though perhaps more in the mode of Ben Jonson than of Shakespeare.",
          "If the question pertains to the beliefs in themselves, the answer would be positive in terms of the past, when there were so many Tolstoyans, but not now, when he must be read in the company of Homer, the Yah wist, Dante, and Shakespeare, as perhaps the only writer since the Renaissance who can challenge them.",
          "Yet What Is Art? (1896)—his fierce denunciation of Greek tragedy, Dante, Michelangelo, Shakespeare, and Beethoven—is contravened by the astonishing Hadji Murad, the short novel he wrote between 1896 and 1904 but left unpublished when he died.",
          "the hero is a Shakespearean version of Tolstoy in an ironic triumph of the dramatist over the writer who most maligned him.",
          "Tolstoy has learned from Shakespeare (though he would have denied it) the art of juxtaposing highly diverse scenes in order to achieve more complex continuities than a simpler progression could provide.",

          "Only Falstaff pleased him, and Lear in particular drove him wild with disdain.",
          "His strongest character, Anna Karenina, has profound strains of Shakespeare in her, for which Tolstoy, who loves her, will not forgive her.",
          "Since it is not hyperbolical to observe that Tolstoy actually hated Shakespeare, it is only just to add that he also feared him.",
          "Hadji Murad is the grandest exception in late Tolstoy, for here the old shaman rivals Shakespeare.",
          "Shakespeare’s extraordinary faculty for endowing even the most minor characters with exuberant being, for ramming them with life, is slyly absorbed by Tolstoy.",

          "whom we come to know as we know Shakespeare’s great warriors: Othello, Antony, Coriolanus, or the bastard Faulconbridge in King John.",
          "For once, like Shakespeare, Tolstoy speaks through a voice not at all his own and enacts the great role of Hadji Murad, the natural man as epic hero.",
          "He is a Shakespearean protagonist whose deepest ethos is the capacity for inner change",
          "Shakespeare upset Wittgenstein, who apparently feared the playwright of Hamlet and King Lear almost as much as Tolstoy did.",
          "More than any other writer since Shakespeare, Tolstoy had the gift of representing the struggle for power in a warring world, and Hadji Murad is worthy of comparison to Antony in Antony and Cleopatra or to Conrad’s Nostromo.",

          "In Iago and Edmund, as in Hedda, there is a playfulness gone rancid, and insofar as the sublime Falstaff yields to a certain rancidity, a trollishness appears in him also.",
          "Ibsen, like Cervantes and Shakespeare, is not interested in the Fall of Man.",
          "For many years I have taught that Freud is essentially prosified Shakespeare: Freud’s vision of human psychology is derived, not altogether unconsciously, from his reading of the plays.",
          "Shakespeare was the greatest of writers.",
          "Shakespeare is the inventor of psychoanalysis; Freud, its codifier.",

          "“I should hesitate between Dante and Shakespeare, but not for long. The Englishman is richer and would get my vote.”",
          "Joyce, a superb reader of Shakespeare, as well as a powerful misreader, builds through the Macbeth allusions to suggest that the Joycean, Shakespearean, Earwickian imagination is the killer, just as Macbeth’s extraordinary and proleptic strength of imagination has a murderousness all its own, which it imposes upon the rest of the play.",

          "Hodgart demonstrates that the Macbeth act 5, scene 5 soliloquy, the famous “Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow,” is echoed almost entire, as is Hamlet’s “To be or not to be” monologue, but each is scattered and strung out through the text of the Wake, an act of dispersal that is both useful to Joyce’s purposes and something of a revenge on the prevalence of Shapesphere!",
          "not just Shakespeare but all writers were at once everyone and no one, a single, living labyrinth of literature.",

          "Since that voyage goes past harbors as infinite as Dante, Chaucer, Montaigne, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy, all of whom amply compensate a lifetime’s rereadings",
          "Again, there are character traits that Shakespeare shares with Montaigne, but Montaigne’s life of creative retirement was punctuated by high politics and civil war.",
          "It is not a philosophy; it is no didactic purpose; it is not even a being stirred by the uncertainty of human existence or by the power of destiny, as in the case of Montaigne and Shakespeare.",
          "Perhaps one could designate a composite author, Montaigne-Molière, for the greatest of essayists was the spiritual father of Shakespeare’s only rival as a comic dramatist.",
          "He has a surprising affinity to Shakespeare, in which a mutual relation to Montaigne may play a part.",
          "Both characters stem from aspects of Montaigne, and both justify Nietzsche’s savage, permanently disturbing apothegm",
          "Nietzsche’s vehement insight applies to speaking, not to writing, so it is antithetical to the art of Montaigne the essayist.",
          "Montaigne’s triumph was to fuse himself and his book in an overt act that has to be called originality",
          "Like every major canonical author, Montaigne startles the common reader at each fresh encounter",
          "He can be interpreted as skeptic, humanist, Catholic, Stoic, even Epicurean, very nearly what you will.",
          "His scope and capaciousness sometimes approach Shakespearean dimensions, and one way to consider him, though he knew nothing of Shakespeare while Shakespeare knew something of him, is as the largest-scale of all Shakespearean characters, huger than Hamlet as a questing self.",
          "Montaigne changes as he rereads and revises his own book; more perhaps than in any other instance, the book is the man is the book.",
          "Montaigne, in his final phase, associated his stance regarding life with that of the common people; but Molière, like Shakespeare, rarely gives us an insight into his own deepest sympathies.",
          "I resort to Montaigne against the critics, if we are to save Alceste from them.",
          "Montaigne taught Molière the pragmatic elusiveness of truth—a superb lesson for an actor to learn, and one that would have benefited Alceste if he could have borne it, but he could not.",
          "Montaigne and Molière alike avoid the tragic vision that Lucien Goldmann ascribed to Pascal and Racine in The Hidden God.",
          "The movement from humanism to celebration of the common life, which Frame traced in Montaigne, was thoroughly absorbed by Molière, whose ideal audience would have been the honest men with whom Montaigne had replaced the humanistic ideal.",
          "Montaigne’s originality had been the self-portrait, hardly the stuff from which a comic playwright could fashion his work.",
          "I surmise that Molière took Montaigne’s hint but inverted the self-portraiture or turned it inside out.",
          "Alceste, forceful and admirable as I find him to be, is the direct consequence of not acting upon Montaigne’s admonition that concludes “Of Experience.”",
          "as we more naturally expect to find in the skeptical Montaigne and in Freud, for whom religion was an illusion.",
          "Emerson is a wisdom writer, like Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Freud, and his precursor, Montaigne.",
          "indeed it is the mind of our age, as Montaigne was the mind of Shakespeare’s.",

          "Unamuno, as sublimely crazy as his lord, Don Quixote, delightfully comments, “All of which should teach us to liberate galley slaves precisely because they will not be grateful to us for it.”",

          "Don Quixote, of course, imposes moral constraints upon his sexual desires to such an extent that he might as well be a priest, which according to Unamuno he truly was: a priest of the true Spanish church, the Quixotic.",
          "The tragic sense of life, discovered by Unamuno in Don Quixote, is also the faith of Moby-Dick.",
          "The Don’s motive, according to Unamuno, is eternal fame, interpreted as “an expansion of the personality in space and time.”",
          "As I do, Unamuno took most seriously the Don’s sublimated desire for Aldonza Lorenzo and his subsequent Beatrice-like exaltation of her as the angelic if unfortunately enchanted Dulcinea, which allows us to see the knight in something close to his full complexity.",

In the company of his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, his exploits blossom in all sorts of wonderful ways. While Quixote's fancy often leads him astray - he tilts at windmills, imagining them to be giants - Sancho acquires cunning and a certain sagacity. Sane madman and wise fool, they roam the world together, and together they have haunted readers' imaginations for nearly four hundred year...",

In fact, it is a compelling adventure story with richly drawn characters and has earned a place in both literary and American history. Stowe's puritanical religious beliefs show up in the novel's final, overarching theme--the exploration of the nature of Christianity and how Christian theology is fundamentally incompatible with slavery.",
