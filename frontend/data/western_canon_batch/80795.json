In the company of his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, his exploits blossom in all sorts of wonderful ways.

Sane madman and wise fool, they roam the world together, and together they have haunted readers' imaginations for nearly four hundred year...",

Gregory of Tours (c.A.D. 539-594) intended his HISTORY to be a chronicle of events and included the 21 years he spent as Bishop of Tours. This volume contains all ten books of the HISTORY. As Gregory unravels the bewildering events of those decades, what emerges is no dry historical document but a colorful, detailed and moving pageant.",

From an analysis of the dominating ideas of the times - those that held the medieval world together, supported its religion and informed its art and literature - emerges the style of a whole culture at the extreme limit of its development.",

Unul dintre poetii care au pus in functiune mecanismul miscarii simboliste, Baudelaire a devenit aproape sinonim cu decadenta aplicata literar. Spre deosebire insa de poetii romantici, Baudelaire se inspira din viata citadina a Parisului. El argumenta ca arta trebuie sa creeze frumusete chiar si din cele mai josnice situatii.",
