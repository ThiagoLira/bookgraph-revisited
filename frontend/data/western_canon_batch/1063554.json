The highest human good, then, is that activity that is an end in itself. That good is happiness. When we aim at happiness, we do so for its own sake, not because happiness helps us realize some other end. The goal of the Ethics is to determine how best to achieve happiness. This study is necessarily imprecise, since so much depends on particular circumstances",

Stowe's puritanical religious beliefs show up in the novel's final, overarching theme--the exploration of the nature of Christianity and how Christian theology is fundamentally incompatible with slavery.",

Si en algo difiere de las otras autobiografias es una mayor ingenuidad. Se distingue de ellas en el enfasis que pone en las aventuras emotivas e intelectuales del protagonista.",

        "description": "The Phoenix and the Turtle is an allegorical poem about the death of ideal love by William Shakespeare. It is widely considered to be one of his most obscure works and has led to many conflicting interpretations. It has also been called \"the first great published metaphysical poem\".\nThe title \"The Phoenix and the Turtle\" is a conventional label. As published, the poem was untitled. The \"turtle\" is the Turtledove, not the shelled reptile.",

        "description": "Aldous Huxley spares no one in his ironic, piercing portrayal of a group gathered in an Italian palace by the socially ambitious and self-professed lover of art, Mrs. Aldwinkle. Here, Mrs. Aldwinkle yearns to recapture the glories of the Italian Renaissance, but her guests ultimately fail to fulfill her naive expectations.
