It is the story of one Phillip Vanderdecken, and his search for a piece of the \"one true cross.\" From the writer who inspired Herman Melville to take to the seas, this is an exciting work which combines the thrill of the narrative chase with an examination of the theme of religious tolerance, which has possibly a greater resonance today.",

In the ruins of an ancient stone house in Ireland is found the diary of an elderly man who lived alone with his sister and their pets, and who longed for his lost love. The diary tells of how the man explores a cyclopean cavern beneath the house and fights off swarms of white pig-like monsters pouring up from below. Then, in a visionary sequence, he breaks through to an alternate space-time....",
