Here, in six remarkable essays, Umberto Eco explores in depth questions of reality, perception, and experience. Basing his ideas on common sense, Eco shares a vast wealth of literary and historical knowledge, touching on issues that affect us every day. At once philosophical and amusing, Kant and the Platypus is a tour of the world of our sense...",

In the original edition, Steiner provided readers with the first systematic investigation since the eighteenth century of the phenomenology and processes of translation both inside and between languages. Taking issue with the principal emphasis of modern linguistics, he finds the root of the \"Babel problem\" in our deep instinct for privacy and territory,....",

        "description": "This gaudy, wild, and raw tale of a war-torn 17th Century Europe depicts Simplicissimus as the eternal innocent, the simple-minded survivor. We follow him from an orphaned childhood to the casual atrocities of occupying troops, through his own soldiering adventures, and up to his final vocation as a hermit alone on an island. Mike Mitchell's superb translation allows readers to enjoy more fully one of the great masterpieces of European literature and the first German bestseller.",

          "The author draws a parallel between his own allusions to Wittgenstein and Kroeber’s allusions to Mann and Brecht, implying Wittgenstein is treated as a philosophical reference point; however, Plato is not mentioned in the excerpt and must be excluded. Correction: Wittgenstein is mentioned, but no book title is given — yet Wittgenstein is not Plato. No citation for Plato exists. Re-evaluating: only Wittgenstein, Mann, Brecht, and Lull are referenced as authors without book titles. But Wittgenstein, Mann, and Brecht are mentioned as allusions, not as cited sources of ideas in the narrative sense. The only clear book citation is Ars Magna of Raymond Lull. The others are literary allusions, not citations of their works as sources of ideas. The rule says: 'Focus ONLY on citations that appear within the narrative prose.' The mention of Wittgenstein, Mann, and Brecht is in the context of Kroeber’s translation choices — not as authoritative sources of ideas, but as stylistic references. Therefore, only Raymond Lull’s Ars Magna qualifies as a cited book. The mention of Ecclesiastes is a book, but it is not attributed to an author — it is referred to by its title. The original author of Ecclesiastes is traditionally Solomon, but the text does not name him. The excerpt refers to 'the book of the Bible known as Ecclesiastes' without naming Solomon as author. Therefore, per rules, if no author is named, we cannot invent one. So only Raymond Lull is cited with a specific book title. The other references (Wittgenstein, Mann, Brecht) are person references without book titles. So we include them with title: null. But the rule says: 'If an author is mentioned as a source of ideas...' — are Wittgenstein, Mann, and Brecht mentioned as sources of ideas? The text says: 'he even inserted vague allusions to Mann and Brecht – this was not unfaithful to my original text, because I inserted allusions to Wittgenstein.' So the author is saying that he inserted allusions to Wittgenstein, and Kroeber inserted allusions to Mann and Brecht. So Wittgenstein, Mann, and Brecht are cited as sources of allusions — i.e., as sources of ideas or stylistic references. Therefore, they qualify as person references. So we must include them with title: null.",
          "The author references old Greek poets in general as practitioners of lipograms, but does not cite a specific work by Plato; however, since Plato is not explicitly named and no specific author is identified, this citation does not qualify under the rules as no named original author is referenced.",
          "The author invokes Plato as the philosophical source of the idealized, non-carnal aesthetic that Aschenbach embodies, framing his internal conflict as a departure from Platonic purity.",
          "The author invokes Plato’s metaphysical framework metaphorically to critique the notion of pre-existing, ideal meanings that translation seeks to recover."

Thus, in an elegant anagram (translation = lost in an art), Pulitzer Prize-winning author and pioneering cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter hints at what led him to pen a deep personal homage to the witty sixteenth-century French poet Clement Marot.\"\nLe ton beau de Marot\" literally means \"The sweet tone of Marot\", but to a French ear it suggests \"Le tombeau de Marot\"--that is, \"The tomb of Marot\".

        "contexts": [
          "It must be clear that my subject matter is what Jakobson called translation proper (that is, from one natural language into another).",
          "Here I feel embarrassed, because I have to criticise one of the scholars I have most admired in my life, and whom I still consider a master and an unforgettable friend – the late Roman Jakobson. But Jakobson was once responsible for a possible confusion. Translation and interpretation In his essay on the linguistic aspects of translation, Jakobson (1959) suggested that there are three types of translation: intralinguistic, interlinguistic and intersemiotic.",
          "that I have decided to consider as cases of interpretation but not as cases of translation. There are cases in which, in order to make the meaning of a word or of a sentence clear, we use an interpretant (in the Peircean sense) expressed in a different semiotic system. Think for instance what happens when I explain the sense of a verbal utterance by ostension, that is, when we use an object to ‘translate’ the meaning of a verbal expression, or the inverse, as when a child points his or her finger towards a car and I say that it is a car. In all the above cases, certainly, the new expression aims at interpreting a previous expression, but in different circumstances the same device could interpret different expressions. If we use the term to translate in a metaphorical sense, many interpretations are forms of translation (and in the case of a silent language that reproduces the letters of the alphabet by given gestures it will be a form of transliteration). In passing from certain semiotic systems to others these forms of interpretation act as though they were interpretations by synonymy – with the same limits and strictures that hold for verbal synonymy. But other cases would hardly be defined as translations, not even in a metaphorical sense. If one wants to explain the verbal expression Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony in C Minor, one can undergo the effort of showing the ‘real’ musical object (by playing a disc or by taking the interlocutor to a concert hall). But usually one can sol-fa the beginning of that symphony (hoping that the musical memory of the interlocutor will do the rest). Likewise if somebody asks me what composition has just been broadcast on the radio, I can say it is Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony in C Minor. A sufficient interpretation could also be to answer that this is one of Beethoven’s symphonies. Anyway, what characterises all those interpretations is the fact that the interpretant belongs to a different semiotic system from the interpretandum, and that their difference is due to the fact that their substance is produced by the segmentation of a different continuum or matter. If I recite Hamlet in Italian I change the form and the substance of the expression, but I remain within the boundaries of the same continuum or matter (sounds produced by a human throat). If on the contrary I represent Hamlet killing Polonius in a painting I have changed the expression matter. Differences in continuum or matter are fundamental in a semiotic theory. Think for instance of the various debates on the presumed omnipotence or effability of verbal language. Lotman said that verbal language is the primary modelling system but it cannot translate everything into its own terms. Hjelmslev7 distinguished between limited and unlimited languages. For instance, the language of formal logic is limited in comparison to a natural language: given the most elementary logical formula (p ⊃ q) one can not only translate into English (if P then Q) but also variously interpret (if smoke then fire, if fever then illness), or even, counterfactually, If Napoleon were a woman then he would have married Talleyrand. On the contrary, given the sentence If your son John has your own family name then it means that you have legally acknowledged him, it is true that in a logical language it can be translated as p ⊃ q, but nobody could trace the original sentence from the formula. It seems difficult to translate into words what is expressed by Beethoven’s Fifth, as it is also impossible to ‘translate’ into music the whole Critique of Pure Reason. The phenomenon of ekphrasis permits one to describe an image by words, but no ekphrasis of The Marriage of the Virgin by Raphael can render either the perspective we see when looking at the painting, or the soft harmony of the colours. Let us now consider the importance that a change in matter takes in cases of so-called intersemiotic translation, that one that Jakobson defined as transmutation and that is sometimes called adaptation."

          "Favorinus agrees with this, since – he says – Fronto had previously described flavus as a mixture of green and white. But one should remember that, as a matter of fact, Fronto had said that flavus was green, white and red, and a few lines before he had classified flavus among various gradations of red! Let me exclude any explanation in terms of colour-blindness. Too easy. Gellius and his friends were erudite; they were not describing their own perceptions, they were elaborating upon literary texts coming from different centuries. Can one say that they were considering cases of poetic invention where, by a provocative use of language, fresh and uncommon impressions are vividly depicted? If that were the case, we would expect from them more excitation, more marvel, and more appreciation for these stylistic tours de force. On the contrary, they propose all these cases as examples of ordinary language. Unable as they were to tell literature from daily life (or uninterested in daily life, that they only knew through literature) they proposed these cases as though they were examples of ordinary language. The way of distinguishing, segmenting, organising colours varies from culture to culture. Even though some transcultural constants have been isolated, it seems rather difficult to translate colour terms from languages which are distant in terms of centuries or of space. If one uses the term colour to mean the pigmentation of substances in the environment, one has not said anything about chromatic perception: there is a difference between pigments as chromatic reality and our perceptual response as chromatic effect. The chromatic effect, it seems, depends on many factors: the nature of surfaces, light, contrast between objects, previous knowledge, and so on. Daltonism represents a social enigma, difficult to solve, purely for linguistic reasons. To think that colour terms are simply denoting differences suggested by the visible spectrum is like thinking that genealogical relationships presuppose a unique kinship structure which is the same for every culture. Instead, in colours as in parenthood, terms are defined by their oppositions to and differences from other terms, and all of them are defined by a system. Daltonists have perceptive experiences different from those of normal people, but they refer to the same linguistic system. Hence, the cultural facility of color blinds; functioning on differences in brightness – in a world that everyone else sees as differentiated by hue. Red-and-green color-blind people talk of reds and greens and all shades of it using the same words most of us assign to objects of a certain color. They think and talk and act in terms of ‘object color’ and ‘color constancy’ as do the rest of us. They call leaves green, roses red. Variations in saturation and brilliance of their yellow give them an amazing variety of impressions. While we learn to rely on differences of hue, their minds get trained in evaluating brilliance. Most of the red-and-green blind do not know of their defect and think we see things in the same shades they do. They have no reason for sensing any conflict. If there is an argument, they find us fussy, not themselves defective. They heard us call the leaves green and whatever shade leaves have for them they call green.7 Commenting on this passage, Marshall Sahlins8 not only insists on the theory that colour is a cultural matter, but remarks that in every test of colour discrimination one assumes that classification of colours and utterance of colour names are linked to the representation of an actual experience. On the contrary, when one utters a colour term one is not directly pointing to a state of the world, but is rather connecting or correlating that term with a cultural unit, a concept due to a given segmentation of the chromatic continuum. The utterance of the term is determined, obviously, by a given sensation, but the transformation of the sensory stimuli into a precept is in some way determined by the semiotic relationship between the linguistic expression and the content culturally correlated to it. To what sense experience does one refer to when uttering the name of a colour? The Optical Society of America classifies between 7.5 and 10 million colours which can theoretically be discriminated. A trained artist can discriminate and name a great many hues, which the pigment industry supplies and designates with numbers."
