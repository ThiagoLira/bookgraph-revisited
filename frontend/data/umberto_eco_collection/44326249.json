But on the foggy night that Hammer took that chance, his encounter with a gun-toting thug and a girl on the lam ended with both strangers dead. Soon Hammer is caught in a web of sinister gangsters and beautiful women the likes of which he's never seen -- and his only way out is to kill and kill again...even with his bare hands.",

Through his unforgettable gallery of characters, Dostoyevsky provides a provocative look at the human motivations of obsession and possession with unflinching philosophical and moral insight. A masterpiece of dramatic literature by one of the greatest novelist of all time.",

          "They were the leading lights—as we were told at school—in a battle against the medieval world... Yet what did Renaissance Platonism do? It set Plato against Aristotle, discovered the Corpus Hermeticum or the Chaldean Oracles, and built a new knowledge upon an ancient wisdom that antedated Jesus Christ.",
          "Contrary to Plato, who said that the representation of ugliness should be avoided, from Aristotle onwards it has been admitted in all periods that even the ugliness in life can be beautifully portrayed...",
          "A holist maintains (rightly) that the notion of space has a different meaning in the Aristotelian and Newtonian systems, thus making them incommensurable...",
          "Achilles will cover his unit of length in his unit of time. There is also talk of topological paradoxes, and some have said that the Möbius strip is paradoxical. I find nothing paradoxical about it. It may seem improbable that a twist suffices to turn a two-sided surface into a single-sided one, but in fact it happens, and we have seen this; all this means is that topology is a little more complex than Euclidean geometry. There are far more serious paradoxes, one of the most famous of which is the barber paradox proposed by Bertrand Russell. It comes in an ingenuous version and a subtler one. The first is: “The village barber shaves all the men who do not shave themselves. Who shaves the village barber?” Obviously, he cannot shave himself because he only shaves those who do not shave themselves, and it is presumed that no others in the village are appointed to shave anyone. I put this paradox to my children when they were young and they suggested three solutions: perhaps the village barber is a woman; or the barber does not shave and has a very thick beard; or the barber does not shave but rather burns off his beard, no doubt leaving his face horribly scarred. Actually, the paradox should be stated like this: “Among the inhabitants of a village there is one and only one barber, a well-shaven man. The sign above his shop says, ‘the barber who shaves all those who do not shave themselves.’ The question at this point is: Who shaves the barber?’ Modern logic and mathematics have proposed many antinomies for the resolution of very subtle problems that I will not deal with here. Rather, I shall limit myself to mentioning some other successful antinomies—for example, this one, cited by Aulus Gellius. The story goes that Protagoras gave legal training to a promising young man, Evatlo, and he required Evatlo to pay only half the fee upfront, saying that the student could pay the rest when he won his first case. Evatlo, however, did not go on to practice law, but went into politics instead, and so he never won his first case because he never actually had one."
