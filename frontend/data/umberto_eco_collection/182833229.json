          "“Writing a thesis,” Eco wrote, “requires a student to organize ideas and data, to work methodically, and to build an ‘object’ that in principle will serve others.\nIn reality, the research experience matters more than the topic.”",
          "Each type of index card should have a different color, and should include in the top right corner abbreviations that cross-reference one series of cards to another, and to the general plan.\nThe result is something majestic.",
          "Eco has acknowledged this throughout his career.\nWhether writing about Thomas Aquinas, James Bond, fascism, or semiotics, he has consistently succeeded in entertaining and informing his readers at the same time.",
          "Eco was aware of this predicament.\nAs a university professor, he knew that the majority of students in Italian universities seldom attended classes, that very few of them would continue to write and do research, and that the degree they eventually earned would not necessarily improve their social conditions.",
          "It was a momentous transformation, as Eco recognized in his introduction to the book: “Today the Italian university is a university for the masses.\nStudents of all social classes arrive from a variety of high schools.”",

          "The author interprets Eco’s filing system as a philosophical practice—an ordering of the mind that values procedure over outcome and cultivates accuracy and intellectual pleasure.",
          "The author notes Eco’s broader literary and intellectual approach, using his thesis guide as an extension of his lifelong commitment to making humanities discourse engaging and accessible.",
          "The author references Eco’s recognition of systemic educational challenges, portraying the book as a response to democratized higher education without compromising rigor.",
