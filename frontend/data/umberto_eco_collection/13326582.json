          "James Joyce, the supreme theorist on epiphany, had read, loved, and was inspired by D’Annunzio’s novel.\n“By an epiphany Stephen meant a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether in the vulgarity of speech or of gesture or in a memorable phrase of the mind itself” (Stephen Hero).\nThis experience always appears in Joyce as fiery.\nIn his Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, the word fire is repeated fifty-nine times, and flame and flaming thirty-five times, not to mention other similar words, such as radiance or splendour.",
          "And then Joyce: “His thinking was a dusk of doubt and self-mistrust, lit up at moments by the lightnings of intuition, but lightnings of so clear a splendour that in those moments the world perished about his feet as if it had been fire-consumed; and thereafter his tongue grew heavy and he met the eyes of others with unanswering eyes, for he felt that the spirit of beauty had folded him round like a mantle.”"

Consider what is hidden in the nostrils, in the throat, in the stomach: everywhere, filth . . . and we are repelled to touch vomit and ordure even with our fingertips.

          "The concept of epiphany (if not the term) first appears with Walter Pater in the conclusion to his essay on the Renaissance.\nIt is no surprise that the famous conclusion opens with a quote from Heraclitus.\nReality is a sum of forces and elements that arise and gradually fall away, and only superficial experience makes us see them as solid and fixed in an importunate presence: “But when reflexion begins to act upon those objects they are dissipated under its influence, their cohesive force seems suspended like a trick of magic.” We find ourselves among a group of impressions that are unstable, flickering, inconsistent: habit is broken, ordinary life fades away, and from this, beyond this, there remain single moments that can be grasped for an instant and immediately fade away.\n“Every moment some form grows perfect in hand or face; some tone of the hills or the sea is choicer than the rest; some mood of passion or insight or intellectual excitement is irresistibly real and attractive to us—for that moment only.” To maintain this ecstasy is “success in life”: “While all melts under our feet, we may well catch at any exquisite passion, or any contribution to knowledge that seems by a lifted horizon to set the spirit free for a moment, or any stirring of the senses, strange dyes, strange colours, and curious odours, or work of the artist’s hands, or the face of one’s friend” (Walter Pater, The Renaissance: Studies in Art and Poetry, 1873)."

The richest, most depraved man on Earth, Malachi Constant, is offered a chance to take a space journey to distant worlds with a beautiful woman at his side. Of course there's a catch to the invitation--and a prophetic vision about the purpose of human life that only Vonnegut has the courage to tell.",

          "The punishment that most torments the senses of the damned, is the fire of hell . . . Even in this life, the pain of fire is the greatest of all; but there is much difference between our fire and that of hell which, says Saint Augustine, makes ours seem painted . . . Thus the wretched will be surrounded by fire, like wood inside a furnace. The damned will find themselves with an abyss of fire beneath, an abyss above, and an abyss around them. If they touch, see or breathe, they will touch, see or breathe nothing but fire. They will be in the fire like fish in water. But this fire will not only surround the damned, but will enter even their bowels to torment them. Their body will become all fire, so that their bowels will burn within their belly, their heart within their breast, their brains within their head, their blood within their veins, even their marrow with their bones: every lost soul will become in himself a furnace of fire.

In Mein Kampf (My Struggle), often called the Nazi bible, Hitler describes his life, frustrations, ideals, and dreams. Born to an impoverished couple in a small town in Austria, the young Adolf grew up with the fervent desire to become a painter.

However, since the text says 'Pinocchio' and not 'Collodi', and Pinocchio is not the author, we must not attribute it to Collodi unless named. The text says 'Pinocchio', meaning the character or the story by name, not the author. Therefore, since the author of Pinocchio is not mentioned, we cannot extract Collodi. Per rules: only if the author is named. So this is a book reference without author name — but the rules say: if only an author is mentioned, set title to null. Here, the title 'Pinocchio' is mentioned, but not the author. The rule says: extract the original author if possible. But since the author is not mentioned, we cannot invent Collodi. So we must not extract this as a citation. Therefore, this is not extractable under the rules — we must ignore it because the author is not named. So we do not include Pinocchio."

However, the citation excerpt only names the book, not the author explicitly. Let me recheck: the text says 'I was secretly reading The Three Musketeers.' — Dumas is not named here. Thus, per rules, if the author is not mentioned, we cannot infer it. Therefore, Dumas is not cited as an author in the text; only the book title appears. Since Dumas is not named, we do not extract him. We only extract authors explicitly mentioned or implied as sources in the prose. The text does not say 'Dumas' The Three Musketeers' — so we cannot assume. Thus, Dumas is not cited. Correction: only authors named in the text are extracted. Therefore, Dumas is not included."

I saw how it contains within its depths all things bound in a single book by love, of which creation is the scattered leaves: how substance, accident, and their relation were fused in such a way that what I now describe is but a glimmer of that Light. I know I saw the universal form, the fusion of all things, for I can feel, while speaking now, my heart leap up in joy. One instant brings me more forgetfulness than five and twenty centuries brought the quest, that stunned Neptune when he saw Argo’s keel.",

Certainly, provided the impossible thought of the Absolute is replaced by a feeling of the Absolute and therefore by faith, as “the substance of those hoped-for things and argument for things we have not seen” (Dante, Paradise, canto 24, lines 64–65)."

This final work by the distinguished physicist Hans Reichenbach represents the culmination and integration of a lifetime's philosophical contributions and inquiries into the analysis of time. The result is an outstanding overview of such qualitative, or topological, attributes of time as order and direction.\nBeginning with a discussion of the emotive significance of time, Reichenbach turns to a...",

Returning to Hugo, the insurrection is so enormous that we, while reading it, cannot remember all the main characters, or even just their leaders. It is the compunction of this prolonged reading that makes us feel the sublimity of the Vendée. The Royalist revolt is sublime, as must be the picture of the Convention, the very essence of the Revolution. We reach the third book, titled “The Convention.” The first three chapters describe the hall, and already in these first seven pages the abundance of description leaves the reader dazed and deprived of all feeling of space. But it then continues—for another fifteen pages—with the list of the members of the Convention... Hugo, I am sure, knew that his reader would have skipped these pages, as Manzoni did when, contrary to every rule of narrative, he leaves us in suspense with Don Abbondio faced by two villains, and then gives us four pages about local laws and edicts (four in the 1840 edition, but almost six in the 1827 edition)."
