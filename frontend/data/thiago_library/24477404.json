          "But the reader of Descartes and Spinoza should realize that when these philosophers use the term ‘objective’ they are talking about a mental representation of a thing, the thing as an object of thought.",

          "I know, indeed, that the renowned Descartes, though he too believed that the mind has absolute power over its actions, does explain human emotions through their first causes, and has also zealously striven to show how the mind can have absolute control over the emotions.",
          "Spinoza’s appeal to these innate instruments of the intellect, by means of which it forges its own cognitive material for further intellectual work, is reminiscent of Plato and Descartes, who also made use of the notion of “innatism.”",
          "Referring anonymously to Descartes, Spinoza boldly claims that skepticism is really not a genuine problem."
