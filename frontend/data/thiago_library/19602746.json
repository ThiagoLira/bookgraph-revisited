          "Readers are reminded that ‘we read’ translates ‘he says’ of the text, and always indicates a reference to Plato, whose name does not appear in the translation except where it was written by Plotinus: and that all matter shown in brackets is added by the translator for clearness’ sake, and therefore is not canonical.",

          "That the soul ‘falls’ from a higher condition (and thereby constitutes itself as soul) is a notion which Plotinus inherits from Plato himself and the Platonic tradition, but which, as usual, he probes more deeply than his predecessors.",
          "To Plato, unmistakably, there are two distinct orders of virtue, and the civic does not suffice for Likeness: ‘Likeness to God’, he says, ‘is a flight from this world’s ways and things’:21 in dealing with the qualities of good citizenship he does not use the simple term Virtue but adds the distinguishing word civic: and elsewhere he declares all the virtues without exception to be purifications.",
          "It falls into two parts, the first (ch. 1–4) concerned with establishing the Platonic ideal of the exercise of the Intellect against Aristotelian, Epicurean and Stoic alternatives"
