    "description": "Do lobsters feel pain? Did Franz Kafka have a funny bone? What is John Updike's deal, anyway? And what happens when adult video starlets meet their fans in person? David Foster Wallace answers these questions and more in essays that are also enthralling narrative adventures. Whether covering the three-ring circus of a vicious presidential race, plunging into the wars between dictionary writers, or confronting the World's Largest Lobster Cooker at the annual Maine Lobster Festival, Wallace projects a quality...",

It is at this time that he began his engagement with the work of Dostoevsky. Problems of Dostoyevsky's Artis considered to be Bakhtin's seminal work, and it is here that Bakhtin introduces three important concepts.\nFirst, is the concept of the unfinalizable self: individual people cannot be finalized, completely understood, known, or labeled.

Except for the VOGUE WORDS snafu and the absence of a pronunciation entry on trough,74 the above were pretty much the only quibbles this reviewer could find. ADMAU is thorough and timely and solid, as good as Follett’s and Gilman’s and the handful of other great American usage guides of the century.",
          "But none of this is why Bryan Garner is a genius. ADMAU is a collection of judgments and so is in no way Descriptivist, but Garner structures his judgments very carefully to avoid the elitism and anality of traditional SNOOTitude.",
          "Then it occurred to me that if Objectivity still had a lowercase sense unaffected by modern relativism, maybe Authority did as well. So, just as I’d done w/r/t Garner’s use of judgment, I went to my trusty conservative American Heritage Dictionary and looked up authority. Does any of this make sense? Because this was how I discovered that Bryan Garner is a genius.",

In the retelling, Olympus becomes small-town Olinger High School; Chiron is George Caldwell, a science teacher there; and Prometheus is Caldwell's fifteen-year-old son, Peter.

        "description": "The 1934 Second Edition of Webster's New International Dictionary, often referred to in usage circles as 'Webster's Second', was a monumental American English dictionary. Though published by Merriam-Webster, it was sometimes informally attributed to editors like William Neilson or others involved in its compilation. The citation 'Gilman’s ’89 Webster’s' is a misattribution or colloquial shorthand; no such book by 'Gilman' titled 'Webster’s (1989)' exists. The reference in the text is likely pointing to the 1934 edition, which remained the authoritative version through the 1980s and was frequently cited in usage guides like those mentioned in the context.",
