          "Enter media futurologist George Gilder, a Hudson Institute Senior Fellow and author of 1990's Life after Television: The Coming Transformation of Media and American Life.",
          "The single most fascinating thing about Life after Television is that it's a book with commercials.",
          "The book's also largely a work of fiction, plus is a heart-rending dramatization of why anti-TV conservatives, motivated by simple convictions like 'Television is at heart a totalitarian medium' whose 'system is an alien and corrosive force in democratic capitalism' are going to be of little help with our ultraradical TV problems...",
          "television as we know and suffer it is 'a technology with supreme powers but deadly flaws.'",
          "The fibrous TC 'will forever break the broadcast bottleneck' of television's one-active-many-passive structure of image-propagation.",
          "With artful programming of telecomputers, you could spend a day interacting on the screen with Henry Kissinger, Kim Basinger, or Billy Graham.",
          "Leyner's fiction is, in this regard, an eloquent reply to Gilder's prediction that our TV-culture problems can be resolved by the dismantling of images into discrete chunks we can recombine as we fancy."

          "The author cites Gilder's book as a representative example of technologically optimistic conservatism, highlighting its commercial framing and flawed faith in tech solutions to cultural problems.",
          "The author references Gilder's book to critique its fusion of corporate advertising and intellectual discourse, treating it as a cultural artifact of late-capitalist media ideology.",
          "The author uses Gilder's book to illustrate how conservative technological optimism misdiagnoses media culture by reducing complex social issues to technical fixes.",
          "The author quotes Gilder's characterization of television to expose the paradox of blaming media's problems on outdated technology while ignoring deeper cultural complicity.",
          "The author cites Gilder's vision of the telecomputer to satirize the myth of technological liberation, suggesting it merely repackages passive consumption as interactive illusion.",
          "The author references Gilder's speculative scenarios to underscore the eerie commodification of human presence and the flattening of cultural meaning into consumable media experiences.",
          "The author cites Gilder as a predictive voice on television culture, positioning Leyner's fiction as a direct counter-response to Gilder's technological optimism."
