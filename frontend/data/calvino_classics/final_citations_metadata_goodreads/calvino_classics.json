          "For sheer pleasure of reading, I would advise anyone taking up Pliny the Elder’s Natural History to focus mainly on three books: the two containing the fundamentals of his philosophy, that is to say Book 2 (on cosmography) and Book 7 (on man), and — for an example of his unique blend of erudition and fantasy — Book 8 (on land animals).",
          "It has always been the case, I believe, that people do not read Pliny, they go to Pliny to consult him, both to find out what the ancients knew or thought they knew about a certain topic, and to winkle out bizarre facts and curiosities.",
          "Book 1, an index of the whole work, whose charm derives from unpredictable juxtapositions: ‘Fish which have a small stone in their head; Fish which hide in winter; Fish which are influenced by the stars; Fish which have fetched extraordinary prices’; or ‘Roses: 12 varieties, 32 drugs; Lilies: 3 varieties, 21 drugs; Plants which grow from an exudation; Narcissus: 3 varieties; 16 drugs; The plant whose seed can be dyed to produce coloured flowers; Saffron: 20 drugs; Where the best flowers grow; What flowers were known at the time of the Trojan war; Floral patterns in clothes.’",
          "Pliny is also an author who deserves an extended read, for the measured movement of his prose, which is enlivened by his admiration for everything that exists and his respect for the infinite diversity of all phenomena.",
          "In his use of written sources he was both omnivorous and eclectic, but not uncritical: there were facts he recorded as true, others to which he gave the benefit of the doubt, others he rejected as obvious nonsense.",
          "The world is the eternal sky which was not created by anyone, and whose spherical, rotating vault covers all earthly things (2.2).",
          "But the world is difficult to distinguish from God, who for Pliny and the Stoic culture which he embraced is a single deity that cannot be identified with any single portion or aspect, nor with the crowd of Olympian gods (apart perhaps from the Sun, which is the soul, mind or spirit of the heavens (2.13)).",
          "the stars weave the sky and at the same time they are interwoven into the heavenly fabric: ‘aeterna caelestibus est natura intexentibus mundum intextuque concretis’, 2.30",
          "the sky is composed of stars as eternal as God (the stars weave the sky and at the same time they are interwoven into the heavenly fabric: ‘aeterna caelestibus est natura intexentibus mundum intextuque concretis’, 2.30), and is also the air (both above and below the moon) which seems empty and diffuses down here the vital spirit, generating clouds, hail, thunder, lightning and storms (2.102).",
          "novissimum sidus, terris familiarissimum et in tenebrarum remedium’ (‘ultimate star, the star most familiar to those who live on earth, their remedy against the dark’) and for everything her changing phases and eclipses teach us;",
          "he does not accept an infinity of worlds because this world alone is already difficult enough to understand and an infinity would not simplify the problem (2.4).",
          "‘for us who are inside it, the world slips round day and night in silence’ (2.6).",
          "God cannot resurrect the dead, nor make someone who has been alive never have lived; he has no power over the past, over the irreversibility of time (2.27).",
          "‘per quae declaratur haut dubie naturae potentia idque esse quod deum vocamus’ (these facts unquestionably prove the power of nature, which is what we call God), 2.27",
          "‘All these are things of uncertain explanation and hidden in the majesty of nature’ (2.101), or a little later on, ‘Adeo causa non deest’ (There must be some cause for this) (2.115)",
          "Men’s corpses float on their back, women’s on their front, as if nature wanted to respect the modesty of women even after death’ (7.77).",
          "I have seen at night, while the sentries were on guard in front of the trenches, lights in the shape of a star shining on the soldiers’ lances’ (2.101); ‘When Claudius was Emperor, we saw a centaur which he ordered to be sent from Egypt, conserved in honey’ (7.35); ‘I myself saw when in Africa a citizen of Thysdritum change from woman into man on the day of her wedding’ (7.36).",
          "However, I would not give my word for the majority of these facts, preferring as I do to rely on the sources, to whom I refer you in all cases of doubt: I will never tire of citing the Greek sources, since they are not only the most ancient but also the most precise in observation’ (7.8).",
          "the famous list of ‘miraculous and incredible’ characteristics of certain foreign races which was to be so popular in the Middle Ages and afterwards, and was to transform geography into a kind of living freak show.",

          "The author uses this quote to demonstrate Pliny’s empirical skepticism toward metaphysical claims about celestial harmony or sound.",

          "The author cites these statements to illustrate Pliny’s unwavering belief in underlying natural causes, even for inexplicable phenomena.",
          "The author cites this example to show Pliny’s occasional reliance on poetic or psychological analogies rather than empirical evidence in explaining natural phenomena.",
          "The author notes that Pliny’s rare first-hand observations are treated with the same weight as textual sources, revealing his empirical but uncritical methodology.",
          "The author cites this statement to highlight Pliny’s deference to authoritative ancient sources over personal verification, even when dubious.",
          "The author references Pliny’s catalog of monstrous races as a foundational text that influenced medieval and later geographical imagination.",
          "The author cites Pliny as a source of ancient zoological lore that blends factual accounts with mythological creatures, highlighting the overlap between natural history and fantasy."

It is the story of one unremarkable steamship captain, pitted against a storm of incredible fury. Captain Macwhirr has a reputation as a solid, steadfast man, who \"having just enough imagination to carry him through each successive day, and no more\" cannot fully believe any storm would be a match for his powerful ship. So, when the barometer and other clues begin to hint at trouble ahead, he i...",

          "as well as in the swiftness of his ironic asides. But the colloquial is only one of the many registers he deploys, which extend from the lyric to the tragic and sententious and which can all coexist in the same stanza. Ariosto can be of memorable concision, and many of his verses have become proverbial: ‘Ecco il giudicio uman come spesso erra!’ (This is how human judgment errs so often!) or ‘Oh gran bontà de’ cavallieri antiqui!’ (Oh the wonderful goodness of the ancient knights!). But it is not only with such asides that he executes his changes of speed. It has to be said that the very structure of the ottava is based on a discontinuity of rhythm: the first six lines linked by just two alternating rhymes are then followed by a rhyming couplet, which produces an effect which today we would term anticlimax, a brusque shift not only in rhythm but also in the psychological and intellectual atmosphere, from the sophisticated to the popular, from the evocative to the comic. Of course Ariosto plays with these contours of the ottava as the expert he is, but the play could become monotonous without the agility of the poet in giving movement to the stanza, introducing pauses and full stops in varying positions, adapting different syntactic structures to the metre, alternating long and short sentences, splitting the stanza in two or in some cases tagging another stanza on to the first, constantly changing the narrative tenses, switching from the remote past tense to the imperfect, the present, then the future, in short creating a whole array of narrative planes and perspectives. This freedom and ease of movement which we have noted in his versification dominates even more at the level of narrative structure and composition of plot."

          "The author cites Ariosto as a key Renaissance figure whose fantastical works are used as a benchmark for metaphorical elaboration, later noted as saved from the bonfire for aesthetic merit.",

          "The author reflects on the personal and enduring influence of Ariosto’s Orlando Furioso on his own literary sensibility.",
          "The author highlights this specific octave as emblematic of Ariosto’s narrative technique, where a boat signals the onset of a new adventure.",

          "The author notes this stanza as a rare moment of climatic disruption in the Furioso, linking it to Ariosto’s use of exotic place-names to evoke emotional and environmental tension.",
          "The author identifies this octave as the pinnacle of spatial dislocation in Ariosto’s poetry, blending Petrarchan lyricism with dynamic motion.",
          "The author cites this stanza as an example of Ariosto’s eroticism rooted in physical entanglement rather than explicit description.",
          "The author analyzes this passage as Ariosto’s most iconic depiction of erotic anticipation, emphasizing subtlety and veiled exposure over overt sensuality.",
          "The author observes that in this Olimpia episode, Ariosto prioritizes landscape over the nude form, creating a delicate interplay between natural and bodily imagery."

The book begins with a brief history of the river from its discovery by Hernando de Soto in 1541.

Don’t worry about the heavens, the Earth, or their possible undermining, or even about philosophy itself, because as far as the heavens are concerned it is pointless for you to fear for something that you believe to be inalterable and impassive; and as for the Earth, we are seeking to raise her to even greater nobility and perfection by trying to regard her as similar to the heavenly bodies and in a certain sense to place her in the heavens, the place from whence your Aristotelian philosophers banished her.",
          "The most famous metaphor in Galileo — and one which contains within itself the kernel of the new philosophy — is that of the book of Nature written in mathematical language."

With its ingenious structure and its exuberant pretense of being an autobiography, TRISTAM SHANDY fascinates like a verbal game of chess. Milan Kundera has said that it is the eighteenth-century novel he loves best.",
